# Simple Data Input

This is the copy of a copy of a copy. Probably tons of projects like this already exists, i am writing this with mediocre skills just so i can prove something to myself and to use it most simply with one of my own homebrew projects.

**Be careful, this is coded with my local intranet in Mind, there is no security whatsoever, everybody could arbitrarily add/delete/change data rows without any checks**

## What does it even do?

It allows a simple POST/GET Interface to input data in some simple database to later use it for anything. I mostly needed it for some Raspberry/ESP32 sensor project. That and my laziness to research anything.
